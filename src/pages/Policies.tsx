          <p className="mb-2">
            When making a deposit online, you will book the date and submit the
            payment which is sent to our email account. There may be a delay in
            updating the calendar and on rare occasions, there may be a double
            booking. In the event a double booking occurs, the trip will go to
            the charter who booked first. You will be called ASAP if a double
            booking happens to occur to reschedule.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            There will be a 2.6% service fee for PayPal upon deposit. A 30%
            deposit is required for all sea burials.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Deposits Are NON-Refundable. If a reschedule is needed within 30
            days of the booked trip, we will gladly change the date for you. If
            the trip is canceled due to weather or unforeseen circumstances, the
            deposit will be applied to the next agreed upon date for the burial
            ceremony.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Deposits not used in the year of booking are good for one calendar
            year following the original booking. After one year, the deposit
            will be forfeited.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Deposits are to be paid on the day of booking via
            NJSEAMEMORIALS.com.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            In the rare occasion a check must be given as deposit, it will be
            accepted as long as it is not within 30 days of your trip.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Balances are to be paid in CASH on the day of the trip and handed
            directly to the captain.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            On the rare occasion paying in cash is not an option, Venmo or
            PayPal may be used. A 3.5% surcharge will be added for all
            electronic money transfers.

          <p className="">
            Although it is not mandatory, gratuity is customary on all in-person
            sea burials and NOT included in the ceremony cost. The crew provides
            a service and puts great effort into making your burial ceremony
            special. On most occasions, people tip the crew 15-20%.

            Charter Cancellations and Weather
          </h2>
          <p className="">
            Safety is our number one concern and we will be constantly
            monitoring weather up to the day of the trip. The tripâ€™s Captain
            will review the forecast and the office will confirm all trips no
            later than 12 hours prior to departure. If the weather is
            questionable for your ceremony, the final call will be made the
            evening before the trip by 6pm. The person who booked the trip is
            responsible for letting the remainder of their group know about
            weather decisions.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Cancellation of any Ceremony is the decision of our Captain, not the
            customer. Cancellations due to weather will be rescheduled to a
            later date agreeable by both the captain and the person who booked
            the burial.
